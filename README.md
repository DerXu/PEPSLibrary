The PEPS Library is a C++ implementation of all standard Matrix Product State (MPS)
and Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) algorithms.
It requires BLAS, LAPACK, and ARPACK.

The PEPS Library was programmed by Michael Lubasch when he was a PhD student in the
Theory Division of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics where his work was
supervised by Prof. Dr. J. Ignacio Cirac and Dr. Mari-Carmen Ba\~{n}uls.
The PEPS Library is distributed under the PEPS Library License v1.0 (see
